# Aliens Versus Predator: VR and non-VR

> [!TIP]
> Check the new 0.6 update on releases page. **You will need to reupload the asset files into the new app name folder in Sidequest. Any progress made in earlier builds won't be in the 0.6 build as folder location has changed!** You can keep old builds on headset if you wish to continue playing and not lose your progress but is probably best to start afresh. This build is mainly releases of the flat version for Android devices like phones and TVs, Windows and Linux so they can all multiplay! Aliens wall walking still broken though.

This is a fork of [atsb/NakedAvP](https://github.com/atsb/NakedAVP) to use OpenXR for VR headsets like the Meta Quest. Confirmed to work with Quest 1 (v50 OS), Quest 2 and Quest 3 running v2.x OS. 

> [!NOTE]
> Builds now available to run as flat on Android, Windows and Linux as well just like the original game. You can multiplay on a local LAN against other including Quest users!! Mac coming soon.

This is early stage as bugs and fixes are likely needed.

> [!NOTE]
> This is based on the code from _atsb_ over at [atsb/NakedAvP](https://github.com/atsb/NakedAVP) v1.2.3. I've ported to Android and for it to use OpenXR for VR headsets. I have added binaries as an apk for Android 16 VR headsets as well as Windows and Linux exe. They do not include the game files as its not allowed here. See important note below about game assets and there are instructions on how to add them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to supply the games asset files. Buy the game on Steam (often on sale) or find cd/downloads of Aliens Versus Predator Gold Edition. It has to be the Gold Edition as the standard versions 'language.txt' file crashes the game. You can use the standard versions files if you use the Gold Edition language.txt, the videos are different! Check [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=aliens+versus+predator+gold+edition&_sacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_odkw=aliens+versus+predator+gold&_osacat=0&_sop=15) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/aliens_versus_predator_classic_2000) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730/Aliens_versus_Predator_Classic_2000/).

## Step-by-step
1. Install the original pc game from disk/download like normal on your pc.
2. Copy the games assets from **C:\Program Files (x86)\Fox\Aliens versus Predator\** or from your Steam/GOG game directory. You need the following:

![Screenshot of assets files](https://github.com/Bassquake/Aliens-Versus-Predator-VR/blob/master/captures/assets-files.png)

4. Download the [lowercase.ps1](https://github.com/Bassquake/Aliens-Versus-Predator-VR/blob/master/assets/lowercase.ps1) powershell script or find it in the assets folder of this project. Place the script into the folder where the assets are.
5. Run the script in Powershell (type **lowercase.ps1**) and all files will now be lowercase. On windows, if you get a security error, use this command: **powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\lowercase.ps1**. On Linux, run it as: **pwsh ./lowercase.ps1**. (Install pwsh first if it's not there - **sudo apt install powershell** or via Snap, depending on distro.)
6. Plug your headset in via usb.
7. Download the Aliens Versus Predator: VR release apk and install it with [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) using the "Install APK file from folder on computer". (Your headset probably should be in [Developer](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/) mode already):

![Screenshot of apk install](https://github.com/Bassquake/Aliens-Versus-Predator-VR/blob/master/captures/sidequest_install.png)

6. After install completes, you should see this in the "Currently installed apps":

![Screenshot of apk location](https://github.com/Bassquake/Aliens-Versus-Predator-VR/blob/master/captures/sidequest_installed.png)

7. On the headset, run the Aliens Versus Predator:VR in Unknown Sources. This will crash out as the assets haven't been added yet, this is normal and sets the folders and their permissions in place. 
8. Now still in SideQuest, go to "Manage files on the headset".
9. Navigate to "sdcard/Android/data/com.bassquake.quest.avpvr/files". If installing on phone or tv, use the folder "sdcard/Android/data/com.bassquake.android.avpvr/files". (On build 0.5 and older the path is sdcard/Android/data/com.bassquake.avpvr/files).
10. Copy all the game assets into that files folder. The layout should be like so on your device:

## Folder layout for Windows and Linux

To run Aliens Versus Predator on Windows/Linux (flat), download the exe from Releases page, you also need to download and extract the provided libraries zip file into how it looks in screenshot below:

![Screenshot of assets location](https://github.com/Bassquake/Aliens-Versus-Predator-VR/blob/master/captures/assets-files-windows.png)

See below if want to include CD music if you have the physical game second CD, otherwise just click avp_x64.exe (or avp_x86.exe for the 32-bit build) to run!

## CD music
You can skip this if you don't have the audio cd that comes with the game, it'll just play without background music. Or provide your own music! Would need 15 tracks.
- Create a folder in **sdcard/Android/data/com.bassquake.quest.avpvr/files/** called **cd_tracks**.
- Or on Windows just create a folder called **cd_tracks** where the exe and the assets are.
- Rip the CD's audio tracks to Ogg Vorbis 160kbps and copy them over into the **cd_tracks** folder on your headset or Windows game location. Make sure they're lowercase and exactly named as track01.ogg, track02.ogg etc.

## Run it!
Go to Unknown Sources on the headset and click on Aliens Versus Predator: VR.

To run the flat version, on Windows simply run avp_x64.exe (or avp_x86.exe or avp_arm64.exe according to what you're running on). Or on Linux, run the executable or by command as ./avp_x64 (or avp_x86 or avp_arm64). Have fun!
> [!CAUTION]
> This is early stage but is in playable state as Marine and Predator. I'm still looking at how to do the wall climbing on Aliens level. I'm not really much of a programmer, this was done with a lot of help from various ai like Claude, Copilot and Gemini.

## Controls

### Keys
Controls for VR are as follows:

![Control layout](https://github.com/Bassquake/Aliens-Versus-Predator-VR/blob/master/captures/avpvr-controllers.jpg)

If you have Manual Reload on, almost touch controllers close together to trigger it.

I will probably add ability to customise all these.

## Extra features
- Can choose different frame rate in Video/Video Options, runs fine in 120fps mode!
- Can turn on/off the cross-hair in Video/Video Options.
- Frame rate counter can be toggled in Video/Video Options.
- Antialiasing options added for MSAA in Video/Video Options.
- Apparently works with the [HD AvP Redux Mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/aliens-versus-predator-classic-redux/news/avp-classic-redux-20-released) pack! Edit: Seems there’s an issue with the HUD and crosshair for Marine with the Redux Mod. Not sure if can fix.
- Cheat modes can be toggled now for those faint of heart!
